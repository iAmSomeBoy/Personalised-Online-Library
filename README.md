# 📚 Personalised-Online-Library

- This repository is for lazy people… just kidding! 😄  
- Actually, we often read many things randomly on the internet. Sometimes we need to revisit the **same topic** to revise or prepare again, but we forget the original source links and then struggle to find them.
- This repository is a **collection of high-quality and useful links** on many popular topics.
- Instead of searching the internet repeatedly and browsing random content, I created this repo to work like an **online library**.
- Anyone can benefit by reading topics from these carefully selected sources.
- Finally, I want to say that this is a ***Personalised Library***—where you can always return to the **same trusted and already-tested high qualified resources**.
